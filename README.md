The objectively best Twitter video downloader bot now as a Discord bot.

## Usage
Requires Node.js, FFmpeg, and youtube-dl:

```shell
sudo apt install nodejs ffmpeg
sudo pip3 install youtube-dl
```

Once they're installed, install the required modules using npm:
```shell
npm install
```

Finally, put your bot token obtained from the [Discord developers page](https://discordapp.com/developers) inside `config.json` and run `node app.js`.

## Disclaimer
My code is pretty terrible so send pull requests to make it better if you want.

This is a parody of video downloader bots and does not actually send users download links. If you need an actual Twitter video downloader, I recommend [youtube-dl](http://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/).
